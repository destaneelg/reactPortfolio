## React Portfolio
***Made using a CeeVee 10 template 
 

## User Story
```
As an upcoming bootcamp graduate, I need a react portfolio to showcase skills learned to future employers.
```
## Website Functionality
```
GIVEN I am on the web app
WHEN I select a  choice in the header
THEN I am scrolled to the corresponding section.  
WHEN  I am taken to that section 
THEN  I will be given information and resources about the developer 
WHEN I click on the resources
THEN A corresponding tab loads
```
## Obstacles faced during development
```
I had issues getting it deployed to github pages. 
Anytime the portfolio section is updated the template breaks.
```
## Instructions for future development
```
For future development I would like to make a fully functioning contact form. 
```
